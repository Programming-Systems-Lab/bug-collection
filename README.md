# bug-collection
This is a collection of bugs/security vulnerabilities with before and after test cases to be used for research experiments

### Directory Structure
* Bugs -- contains all the bugs that we have found so far


### Bugs Directory
* Bugs are split into C and Java bugs.
* The C Bugs contains a folder called `muplay_bugs`. Inside it is a Makefile and all necessary information associated with the bugs to make it run
* The Java bugs contains a folder called Vuls4J which contains a few examples of security vulnerabilities in Java. It also is the beginning of a framework to run and test those vulnerabilities.
